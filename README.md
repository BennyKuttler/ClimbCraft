# ClimbCraft
The app opens to the WallView, which is a blank screen with a button titled "Add Wall" and a button titled "Add Holds".  When "Add Wall" is selected, the user is prompted to choose a photo from their camera roll, which is then displayed in the WallView as selectedWallImage, which can be dragged and magnified by the user (!!although these mechanics still do not completely work properly yet!!).  When the user selects "Add Holds", they are navigated to FolderListView, where they can select a climbing hold brand.  Once a brand is chosen, the user is navigated to HoldGroupView, where all of the hold sets (groups of similar holds) are shown.  When the user selects a holdGroup, they are brought to HoldView, where they can select an individual hold to place onto the wall image.  Once a hold is selected, the user is taken back to the WallView, where the image of the hold is displayed in addition to the selectedWallImage, and the user can move, scale, and rotate this image of the hold.  When the user is content with the orientation and position of the hold, they can tap on the hold and then press confirm.  This will cause the hold to remain stationary and move with the wall image. However, when the user zooms into the wall image, the hold's position with respect to the wall changes, whereas the desired behavior is for the hold to scale with the wall and retain its relative position.
