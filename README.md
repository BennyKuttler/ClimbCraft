# ClimbCraft
The app opens to the WallView, which is a blank screen with a button titled "Add Wall" and a button titled "Add Holds".  When "Add Wall" is selected, the user is prompted to choose a photo from their camera roll, which is then displayed in the WallView as selectedWallImage, which can be dragged and magnified by the user (!!although these mechanics still do not completely work properly yet!!).  When the user selects "Add Holds", they are navigated to FolderListView, where they can select a climbing hold brand.  Once a brand is chosen, the user is navigated to HoldGroupView, where all of the hold sets (groups of similar holds) are shown.  When the user selects a holdGroup, they are brought to HoldView, where they can select an individual hold to place onto the wall image.  Once a hold is selected, the user is taken back to the WallView, where the image of the hold is displayed in addition to the selectedWallImage, and the user can move, scale, and rotate this image of the hold.  When the user is content with the orientation and position of the hold, they can tap on the hold and then press confirm.  This will merge the hold image and the wall image into a single image (!!although the position and size of the hod image is slightly altered during the merging process, which should not occur!!).  The user can then proceed to add more holds to the wall (!!however, as more holds are added, the image takes up significant memory, causing the app to crash!!).
